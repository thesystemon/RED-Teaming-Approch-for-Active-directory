# 📕 CHAPTER 3 – FOOTHOLD & STABILITY

## 🕶️ COMPLETE RED TEAM CHECKLIST (DEEP)

---

## 🧠 1. FOOTHOLD OBJECTIVE DEFINITION

☐ Clearly define **foothold purpose** (observe, survive, prepare)
☐ Confirm foothold is **temporary or long-term**
☐ Decide acceptable **activity level** (passive / minimal)
☐ Align foothold goals with engagement scope
☐ Confirm foothold supports **future enumeration**

📌 *Red team mindset:*

> “Foothold exists to buy time, not to gain power.”

---

## ⏸️ 2. POST-ACCESS PAUSE & OBSERVATION

☐ Intentionally delay all actions after access
☐ Observe environment response to login
☐ Monitor for forced resets, banners, warnings
☐ Validate no immediate SOC reaction
☐ Allow environment to “settle”

📌 *Senior red team habit:*

> Silence is the first test of safety.

---

## 🔁 3. ACCESS STABILITY VERIFICATION

☐ Confirm access is **repeatable**
☐ Validate session persistence behavior
☐ Understand idle timeout expectations
☐ Identify password rotation pressure
☐ Confirm access is not single-use or temporary

📌 *Unstable access = unreliable attack path*

---

## 👤 4. USER BEHAVIOR ALIGNMENT

☐ Understand normal behavior of compromised identity
☐ Align login frequency with role expectations
☐ Avoid actions outside job responsibility
☐ Avoid accessing unrelated systems
☐ Maintain boring, predictable patterns

📌 *Golden Rule:*

> The best foothold looks unproductive.

---

## 🧠 5. IDENTITY TRUST & VISIBILITY ANALYSIS

☐ Evaluate how trusted the user is internally
☐ Identify if user is known to IT/security
☐ Assess likelihood of manual review
☐ Determine if user is high-profile or low-profile
☐ Classify identity as low, medium, or high risk

📌 *High trust often means high visibility.*

---

## 🧩 6. ENVIRONMENT SENSITIVITY ASSESSMENT

☐ Assess how reactive the environment feels
☐ Identify signs of aggressive monitoring
☐ Note authentication logging strictness
☐ Observe response time to anomalies
☐ Estimate SOC maturity indirectly

📌 *Red teamers feel the environment before touching it.*

---

## 🛑 7. ACTIVITY RESTRICTION DISCIPLINE

☐ Avoid unnecessary navigation
☐ Avoid privilege checks
☐ Avoid configuration changes
☐ Avoid curiosity-driven actions
☐ Keep footprint minimal

📌 *Curiosity kills footholds.*

---

## 🔍 8. INTERNAL PRESENCE CONFIRMATION

☐ Confirm network zone placement
☐ Identify whether access is segmented
☐ Understand boundary limitations
☐ Identify reachable vs unreachable areas
☐ Avoid probing boundaries at this stage

📌 *Mapping comes later — survival comes first.*

---

## 🧠 9. FAILURE & LOSS ASSUMPTION

☐ Assume foothold can be lost anytime
☐ Prepare mental exit strategy
☐ Avoid dependency on single session
☐ Ensure no irreversible actions taken
☐ Keep engagement recoverable

📌 *Professional red teamers expect failure.*

---

## 🧭 10. ENUMERATION READINESS PLANNING (NO EXECUTION)

☐ Mentally identify future enumeration targets
☐ Decide what NOT to enumerate first
☐ Assess which actions carry high detection risk
☐ Align enumeration plan with identity role
☐ Keep plan flexible

📌 *Planning is silent — execution waits.*

---

## 🛡️ 11. OPSEC INTEGRITY CHECK

☐ No abnormal access times
☐ No behavior deviation
☐ No privilege boundary crossing
☐ No excessive session activity
☐ No alerts suspected

📌 *Foothold phase is OPSEC-heavy.*

---

## 📝 12. DOCUMENTATION & INTERNAL NOTES

☐ Document foothold stability assessment
☐ Note identity risk profile
☐ Record environment sensitivity assumptions
☐ Capture decision points
☐ Prepare transition notes for next phase

📌 *Good documentation enables clean reporting.*

---

## 🔄 13. TRANSITION DECISION POINT

☐ Foothold considered stable
☐ Detection risk acceptable
☐ Identity behavior understood
☐ Environment sensitivity gauged
☐ Ready to move into Internal Enumeration

📌 *Foothold ends when confidence begins.*

---

# 🧠 CHAPTER 3 FINAL SUMMARY CHECKLIST

☐ Foothold objectives clear
☐ Access stable & repeatable
☐ Identity behavior aligned
☐ Detection risk low
☐ OPSEC maintained
☐ Enumeration planning ready

---

## 🔑 ONE-LINE TRUTH (CHAPTER 3)

> **A foothold is successful only if defenders forget you exist.**
